 OVERVIEW
------------
This project aims to reveal pricing inefficiencies in American
options, potentially uncovering positive expected value (EV) 
opportunities and arbitrage scenarios. It provides:

  • Tools to fetch and preprocess market data
  • Implementations of option-pricing models (e.g., Binomial, 
    Longstaff-Schwartz Monte Carlo) suited for American options
  • Analytical scripts to compare theoretical prices with 
    real market quotes
